# LangGraph LangServe Containers Development & Deployment

This is a starter kit to test and develop agentic systems using langgraph.

If you're looking for **maximum flexibility and future-proofing**, **LangGraph** is the top choice, especially for advanced developers. **SuperAGI** is best if you're keen on **open-source innovation** and want to contribute to evolving AI systems. **Crew AI** balances ease of use and structure, while **AutoGen** is more suited for rapid, scalable deployment of conversational agents in enterprise contexts.

## Local Setup

Run using docker or locally.

git clone ...

```bash
cd server

#rename .env.example to .env and add OpenAI API Key
mv .env.example .env

poetry install

poetry run uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --reload

open localhost:8000/docs
```

## Test Langserve Python Client

1. Open client folder.

2. Run the notebook

## LangGraph Cloud

The other deployment option is of LangGraph Cloud. So in Summary we can run langgraph in containers and have both options for APIs:

-> Langserve APIs + LangChainRunnable client
-> Langgraph Cloud + LangGraph SDK client

### **2. LangGraph**
   - **Scalability**: 4.7/5  
     LangGraph excels in large-scale, stateful applications where multiple agents need to interact continuously, making it highly scalable for complex, enterprise-grade applications【10†source】【9†source】.
   - **Customization**: 5/5  
     As a framework built on LangChain, LangGraph provides exceptional customization. Developers can fine-tune each agent interaction, making it a robust choice for advanced AI workflows that require precise control over tasks【10†source】.
   - **Ease of Use**: 3.5/5  
     LangGraph’s steep learning curve makes it less accessible for beginners, as understanding graph-based interactions and state management is complex. However, it rewards advanced users with rich functionality【10†source】.
   - **Future-Proof Skills**: 4.9/5  
     With its focus on complex, cyclical agent tasks and state management, LangGraph equips developers with highly **future-proof skills** for next-gen AI systems and enterprise applications【10†source】.

   **Overall Rating**: 4.53/5

### **3. AutoGen**
   - **Scalability**: 4/5  
     AutoGen performs well in environments requiring conversational agents and is designed for **enterprise scalability** through its integration with Microsoft’s tools, although it lacks the depth of control seen in LangGraph or SuperAGI【9†source】.
   - **Customization**: 3.8/5  
     While customizable, AutoGen focuses more on ease of use, particularly in **conversational AI applications**. It lacks the intricate, role-based customization seen in frameworks like Crew AI【12†source】【13†source】.
   - **Ease of Use**: 4.6/5  
     AutoGen's strong point is its accessibility. It allows rapid deployment of conversational agents with minimal setup, making it suitable for businesses seeking **quick solutions** without the need for extensive customization【9†source】【12†source】.
   - **Future-Proof Skills**: 4.2/5  
     Although more focused on conversational AI, AutoGen prepares users for roles involving **chatbots** and **business automation**. However, it lacks the complexity of LangGraph or SuperAGI for more advanced AI workflows【9†source】【12†source】.

   **Overall Rating**: 4.15/5

### **4. Crew AI**
   - **Scalability**: 4.3/5  
     Crew AI is designed to support both experimental and production-grade multi-agent systems, especially in **enterprise settings** where tasks are role-based. It is scalable but may not handle highly complex interactions like LangGraph【10†source】【12†source】.
   - **Customization**: 4.5/5  
     Crew AI offers **role-based** agent design, allowing for significant customization of how agents interact within a structured workflow. However, it’s less flexible for unstructured or cyclical tasks compared to LangGraph【12†source】【10†source】.
   - **Ease of Use**: 4.2/5  
     It’s easier to use than LangGraph but more structured than AutoGen. Crew AI provides a middle ground between flexibility and simplicity, making it a good option for businesses looking for **organized, role-based automation**【12†source】.
   - **Future-Proof Skills**: 4.3/5  
     Crew AI offers solid future-proofing for **enterprise workflow automation** and task management. However, it might not offer as much versatility for those looking to work with cutting-edge, open-ended agentic AI tasks like SuperAGI【10†source】.
